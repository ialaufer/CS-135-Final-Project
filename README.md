# CS-135-Final-Project

## Description
We want to make a website for students at the Claremont Colleges to advertise their skills, e.g, hairstyling, makeup, photography, sewing, consulting, etc.  and to look for people with those skills. It would be similar to Yelp, but only for services and for 5C students. User could log in as service provider.

### Possible Implementations
For Customers:
- They can search and browse for services by categories and subcategories
- They can see rates and descriptions of the service
- They can see the service provider's availability
- They can see the service provider's contact information so they can send an email to set up an appointment

For Service Providers:
- They can post their services
  - Upload photos
  - Add contact information
  - Update description of services: categories/subcategories, price range, location
- They can post their availabilities
- They can check what appointments they already have

Categories
- Arts & Entertainment
- Beauty & Cosmetology
- Health and Medical
- Event Planning
- Food Services
- Home Services
- Professional Services
- Religious Services
- Miscellaneous

### Project Setup
What is visible to the user will be implemented in the public folder.
We will be using a controller, model, and view format.
